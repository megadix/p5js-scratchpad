<p>Create random mazes using a Breadth-First Tree Search Algorithm</p>
<p>
  Admittedly, this is not the best way to build a maze, because mazes created by the program tend to be
  <em>really</em> easy to solve. Nevertheless I'm sure it will serve as a basis for future developments, and maybe
  an autonomous library (i.e. not bound to P5.js)
